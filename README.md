## Ascii-art-output Project

## Objectives
The objective of the ascii-art program is to receive a string as an argument and output the string in a graphic representation using ASCII characters. The program should be able to handle input with numbers, letters, spaces, special characters, and line breaks (\n).
A graphic representation using ASCII characters means that the string will be written using ASCII characters to form a visual representation. Each character in the string will be represented by a series of ASCII characters, following a specific graphical template.

## Usage
To run the program, use the following command on Git Bash terminal:

```
go run . [OPTION] [STRING] [BANNER]
EX: go run . --output=<fileName.txt> something standard
```

To run the Test File:

```
./Tes.sh
```

The program should accept other correctly formatted [OPTION] and/or [BANNER].
Additionally, the program must still be able to run with a single [STRING] argument.
